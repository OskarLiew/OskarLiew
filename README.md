# Hello, I'm Oskar 👋

I am a Data Scientist and Software Developer from Sweden. 🇸🇪

I am interested in how machine learning and data insights can improve quality of life for people and how it can be integrated with trust and transparency. 💡

I have been working with data analysis, active learning, backend development and microservices in python. 🐍

I am currently learning golang and improving my software design chops in general. 💻
